### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate self-taught game developer currently positioned as a Unity Engineer at Bit Egg Inc. My journey in game development started in 2015 when I first dipped my toes into programming, starting with the classic "Hello world" in Java. My initial curiosity was to learn how games are made, and I set out to write "Tetris" to gain a better understanding of every line of code. However, to my surprise, my thirst for knowledge and passion for coding only grew stronger with time. Throughout my journey, I have explored a variety of approaches from using Game Engines to Low-Level Graphic Frameworks, learning design patterns, clean code, and even trying my hand at making my own game engine. Programming has become much more than a hobby for me; it is now one of my greatest passions.

At the time, I was employed as a Commercial pilot with Thai Airways. Unfortunately, my career in aviation came to an end in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this setback presented an excellent opportunity for me to put my passion for programming and game development to good use. In the same year, I was fortunate to secure my first game developer position at Bit Egg Inc. Throughout my professional career in game development, I have encountered various challenging aspects of game-making and over time, my craft has been improving. I am now looking for new and exciting challenges and opportunities to take on in the near future. I believe that my knowledge and skills gained from these experiences can be a valuable asset to your team.
